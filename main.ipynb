    "# Predicting Controversy in Reddit Posts: A Supervised Learning Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "Online platforms are always making constant decisions about what to show, suppress, or highlight to users. Every recommendation made to a user reflects some inherent underlying model of what people likely care about. Most of the time, these models focus on the notion of popularity by attempting to bring posts that will be heavily interacted with to the surface. However, not all engagement is the same. Some content consistently gains upvotes because everyone comes to a consensus that it is harmless or funny, while other content sparks divides in the audience and creates long chains of back and forth replies between users. From a modeling perspective, these posts that generate polarized reactions not only present a unique challenge, but also provide a more meaningful indication about user preferences than simple popularity metrics can really capture. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we explicitly focus on that second category and treat controversy as the target we are trying to predict. As opposed to simply questioning \"which posts will be most popular?\", we frame our primary research question to identify \"which posts are likely to generate a lot of activity because people disagree about them?\" This distinction is important to highlight for multiple reasons. For instance, different platforms might value different approaches to controversial content. While some platforms might want to suppress highly controversial content if they are trying to reduce conflict between users, others may want to deliberately highlight it if they value the boosted engagement derived from it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Reddit is a natural setting for this question due to its unique interaction mechanics. Unlike platforms designed primarily for media viewing, such as TikTok, Reddit's appeal and value lies in its comment sections, where users interact with the original poster or with one another. The site contains engagement metrics like upvotes, downvotes, and comment counts, which all provide signal about the popularity of a post and how divided the audience is in response to it. In this project, we use the Reddit Resubmissions dataset, which aggregates thousands of posts featuring images that have appeared multiple times on the site, along with their titles, timestamps, vote statistics, comment counts, and which subreddit it comes from. Using these signals, we frame controversy prediction as a supervised learning problem: given what is known at the moment of submitting a new reddit post, can we predict which posts are likely to spark widespread disagreement across users? \n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Predictive Task: Identifying Controversial Reddit Posts\n",
    "\n",
    "Predicting controversy requires us to be precise about what kind of behavior we want the model to capture. As previously mentioned, many supervised learning projects based on social media data will mainly focus on popularity by attempting to forecast which posts will receive the most attention or who will engage with them. Controversy is more subtle. It reflects not just how many people interact with a post, but how divided and potentially problematic that interaction is. A post that is mostly agreed upon will naturally behave very differently from one that receives a lot of upvotes/downvotes and long chains of arguments in the comments. Our goal is to distinguish between these two categories solely based on information available at submission time. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.1. Task definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "We frame the task as a **binary classification** problem. Given a newly submitted Reddit post, which includes its title, subreddit, timestamp, and other metadata provided in the dataset, the goal is to predict whether the post will ultimately become controversial or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.2. Why focus on controversy:\n",
    "\n",
    "Focusing on controversy instead of popularity lets us look at a different dimension of platform dynamics. While popular posts tell us what the majority of people agree on, controversial posts tell us where public opinion diverges. This difference does have important practical implications for platforms trying to improve their recommendation algorithms, whether they might want to capitalize on controversy by promoting it or suppress it entirely to limit debate between users.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make this more concrete, we center the project around the following question:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Main research question**: Given a new Reddit post (its title, subreddit, timestamp, and other metadata available at submission time), can we predict whether it will eventually become controversial, meaning that it receives a high volume of votes and comments with a roughly balanced mix of upvotes and downvotes?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.3. Conceptual definition of controversy:\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the dataset does not contain a \"controversy\" label, we must operationalize the definition of controversy ourselves. From a conceptual perspective, we say a post is controversial if it receives a high level of overall engagement combined with a roughly balanced mix of positive and negative feedback. Practically, this means two things. First, a post must surpass a certain threshold on the total number of interactions (upvotes, downvotes, and comments) to even be a candidate. Second, among these posts with high levels of engagement, we can gauge how balanced the user reaction is by creating a ratio of upvotes and downvotes, namely by calculating the smaller number of the upvotes and downvotes divided by the larger one. Posts with both high engagement and a high enough balance ratio can be labeled as \"controversial\", while all others are labeled \"not controversial.\" This effectively gives us labels for our downstream binary classification task. In the exploratory data analysis section, we will expand upon these definitions and choose concrete thresholds based on the actual distributions present in the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.4. Evaluation Strategy:\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer this question, we need to focus on evaluation metrics that reflect how rare controversial posts can be. Using accuracy as the only evaluation metric would be misleading, because a model could achieve high accuracy by predicting the majority class of \"not controversial\" every single time. Instead, we should use metrics that accurately evaluate the performance on the controversial class itself. Precision tells us how often posts predicted to be controversial actually are, while recall tells us how many actually controversial posts we are able to correctly identify out of all the controversial posts in the dataset. Using their harmonic mean, which is expressed in the F1 score, gives us a balanced summary of performance especially when looking at the minority class. We will also report Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC), which expresses how well the model separates controversial from non-controversial posts.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of evaluation procedures, we will split the data into training, validation, and test portions. The training set will be used to fit the model, while the validation set is used for hyperparameter tuning and potentially choosing between different models, and the test set will be used exclusively to report model performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.5 Relevant baseline models\n",
    "\n",
    "We will select three main models relevant to the course content in CSE 158: Web Mining and Recommender Systems to use as our baselines:\n",
    "- **Majority-class predictor**  \n",
    "    This model always predicts that a post is not controversial, which reflects the class distribution of our dataset and also sets the minimal level of performance that any reasonable model should  surpass.\n",
    "- **Logistic regression with metadata**  \n",
    "    Here, we use a simple linear classifier with features like subreddit (one-hot encoded), hour of day, day of week, and title length. This baseline looks at if temporal and patterns within subreddits are sufficient for identifying posts that are likely to become controversial, without even looking at the language of the title itself.\n",
    "- **Jaccard similarity baseline (similar posts)**  \n",
    "    The third baseline is a similarity based approach by representing each post title as a set of tokens and measuring the Jaccard Similarity between titles:\n",
    "      $$ J(A,B) = \\frac{|A \\cap B|}{|A \\cup B|} $$\n",
    "    For a new post, we find the most similar past posts using Jaccard similarity and look at how many were labeled as controversial. If enough of its nearest neighbors are controversial, we predict that the post will also be controversial, and the converse also applies. This baseline lets us explore a simple question: \"Do posts that have similar titles to previously controversial posts tend to become controversial as well?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.6 Assessing the validity of model predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides reporting performance metrics, we also want to make sure that the model is able to generalize well to unseen data as opposed to overfitting to the dataset itself. To do this, we will evaluate all models on a test set that was not used during model training or hyperparameter tuning. We will compare our main model against multiple baselines to make sure that the improvement is not attributed to random chance or due to the majority of posts being non-controversial.  Because controversial posts are generally rare, we also need to make sure to select suitable metrics for this task such that the models are identifying controversial posts in a meaningfu, which will be elaborated upon in a later section.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Exploratory analysis, data collection, pre-processing, and discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.1 Context\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset used in this project is the *Reddit Resubmissions* dataset from the Stanford Network Analysis Project (SNAP). It contains over one hundred thousand Reddit posts that have appeared multiple times on the platform. Each entry in the dataset represents a reddit post and it's image, title, user, subreddit, timestamp, and several other engagement metrics such as the number of upvotes. \n",

    "From these statistics, we can see that every feature related to votes heavily differ between the median and the maximum, indicating an extremely skewed distribution.

Our high engagement threshold must be based on quantiles (ex: top 10%) since absolute numbers can be misleading. Using a balance ratio for upvotes and downvotes is important because the average post is not balanced. \n",

    "The histograms above show the distribution of `total_votes` and `number_of_comments` on a logarithmic scale. Using a log scale allows us to visualize the high volume of low engagement posts and the very sparse high engagement posts simultaneously. From this, we can tell that the distribution is extremely right skewed, where the majority of posts receive low levels of engagement, while a small fraction of posts receive extremely high levels of engagement. The tail extends all the ways into hundreds of thousands of total votes, showcasing that a small subset of posts dominate the activity on the platform. Comments seem to exhibit a similar trend."

It is important to note that we will not be using `total_votes`, `number_of_upvotes`, `number_of_downvotes`, `number_of_comments`, or `balance_ratio` as input features due to the way we framed our task. We are specifically predicting if a post will become controversial based on what is known at the exact moment of submitting a new Reddit post.\n",

    "- `title_length`\n",

We partition the full dataset into a 70/15/15 train/validation/test split using stratified sampling for training our model, model selection, and final evaluation. Stratification helps ensure that all three splits reflect the percentage of controversial posts in distribution of the full dataset.\n",

    "\n",
    "We train a logistic regression model and optimize it via logistic loss using only the metadata features: `subreddit` one-hot encodings, `hour`, `dayofweek`, and `title_length`. This allows us to understand how accurately we can predict controversy using only where and when something is posted, as well as how long the title is.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages**:\n",
    "- Fast and scales well on high dimensional sparse features\n",
    "- Coefficients are intereptable (e.g. which subreddits or times are associated with controversy)\n",
    "- Has a convex objective function, so training will converge to a global optimum instead of getting stuck in a local minima\n",

    "**Disadvantages**:\n",
    "- The decision boundary is linear, making it unable to capture more complex interactions\n",

As a result, our models will tend to predict every single post as non-controversial. The tradeoff here is that accuracy is maximized but precision, recall, and F1 would all be near zero for the controversial class. \n",

    "\n",
    "Overall, we observe that the majority-class baseline achieves the highest accuracy simply by always predicting that a new post will be non-controversial. However, it completely fails to detect controversial posts (precision/recall/F1 = 0). Logistic regression using only the metadata lowers the accuracy slightly to 0.881, but results in some posts being predicted as controversial, showcasing that features like time, subreddit, and length of the title do carry signal. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Jaccard baseline, which is only based on the title text, performs similarly to logistic regression but has lower recall and F1. This suggests that simply relying on text overlap between the titles of different posts is not sufficient, and that metadata provides useful context. Our main model, XGBoost using TF-IDF and metadata, trades a bit more accuracy for the best performance in regards to detecting controversial posts. It achieves the highest preicsion (0.193), recall (0.108), and F1 score (0.138) among all the models, as well as the best AUC (0.633).\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize, while accuracy alone favors the majority-class predictor, the more meaningful metric for this task is the ability to actually detect controversial posts. As established previously, accuracy is misleading due to the inherent class imbalance of the dataset. In a practical sense, the majority baseline is essentially useless because it would never identify a controversial post, which is what platforms like Reddit would be interested in when considering how to tune their recommendation algorithm. In contrast, our XGBoost model's precision of 0.193 means that in about 1 in 5 posts it flags as controversial are actually controversial, while its recall of 0.108 means that it correctly identifies about 11% of all controversial posts in the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although these numbers are far from perfect, they can still be useful from a recommendation standpoint. A platform like Reddit doesn't need a perfect controversy detector. Realistically, it just needs a reasonably informative signal that can be implemented into the rest of the ranking pipeline for deciding which posts to display on users' feeds. Even for a model like ours that only flags 10% of truly controversial posts, its output could be blended into the post ranking logic to either highlight or suppress polarizing posts based on Reddit's priorities on promoting engagement versus reducing conflict between users."
